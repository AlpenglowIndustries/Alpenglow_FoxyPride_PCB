# Foxy_Pride_PCB
An awesome SMT soldering board with space for writing pronouns, where you can choose your own pride-themed colors for the LEDs.
The circuit uses a 555 timer to create a clock signal, which is fed into the decade counter to light the LEDs.
You can change the blink rate by swapping out the capacitor!
